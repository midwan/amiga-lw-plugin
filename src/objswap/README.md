# ObjSwap — Object Replacement Plugin for LightWave 3D

ObjSwap automatically replaces objects during rendering based on frame numbers
encoded in filenames. This is useful for frame-by-frame animation sequences,
such as digital counters, flipbook-style animation, or any effect where different
geometry is needed at specific frames.

## How It Works

1. You load a **base object** in Layout (e.g., `digit`)
2. You activate ObjSwap on that object via **Obj Rep Plug-ins**
3. The plugin scans the same directory for files matching the pattern
   `basename_N` where N is a frame number
4. During preview or render, the object is automatically replaced with the
   correct file for each frame

### Frame Matching Rules

- **Exact match**: If `digit_5` exists, it is shown at frame 5
- **Carry forward**: If no file exists for the current frame, the most recent
  replacement before it is used. For example, if only `digit_0` and `digit_5`
  exist, frames 1–4 will show `digit_0`
- **Before first match**: Frames before the first numbered file show the
  original base object

### Filename Format

The plugin looks for files named `basename_N` where:

- `basename` matches the base object name (case-insensitive)
- `_` (underscore) separates the name from the number
- `N` is the frame number — any number of digits (`5`, `05`, `005` all mean frame 5)
- A file extension is optional (`digit_10.lwo` and `digit_10` both work)

**Examples** — base object `Spaceship`:

| File | Replaces at frame |
|---|---|
| `Spaceship_0` | 0 |
| `Spaceship_10.lwo` | 10 |
| `Spaceship_100` | 100 |
| `Spaceship_0250.lwo` | 250 |

## Installation

1. Copy `objswap.p` to your LightWave plugins directory
2. Add these lines to your LW config file:

```
Plugin ObjReplacementHandler ObjSwap objswap.p ObjSwap
Plugin ObjReplacementInterface ObjSwap objswap.p ObjSwap
```

3. Restart LightWave

## Usage

1. **Load the base object** in Layout. Use the un-numbered version of your
   object (e.g., `digit` rather than `digit_0`). This is the object that will
   appear in the viewport and in frames before the first numbered replacement.

2. **Select the object** in the Objects panel.

3. Click **Obj Rep Plug-ins** and select **ObjSwap** from the popup menu.

4. (Optional) Click **Options** to see which replacement files were found and
   their frame assignments.

5. **Preview or Render** your animation. The object will be replaced at each
   frame according to the matching rules above.

## Known Limitations

- **Viewport after scene load**: When you load a saved scene, the viewport
  will display the object from the last rendered frame (e.g., `digit_9`),
  not the base object. This is a LightWave limitation — Object Replacement
  plugins only take effect during Preview or Render, and LightWave saves the
  last-replaced object in the scene file. To restore the correct display,
  simply render the current frame — the plugin will replace the object with
  the correct one for that frame. This behavior is shared by all LightWave
  Object Replacement plugins (including the LOD plugin).

## Tips

- **File organization**: Keep all numbered variants in the **same directory**
  as the base object. The plugin only scans that directory.

- **Loading any variant**: You can load any numbered variant as the base
  object (e.g., `digit_5`). The plugin will strip the `_5` suffix and
  discover all siblings automatically.

- **Scene persistence**: The plugin settings are saved with the scene file.
  When you reload the scene, the plugin will rescan the directory for
  replacement files.

- **Maximum files**: The plugin supports up to 4096 replacement files per
  object.
